# Code Smell Detection Project Dataset

## Dataset Overview
Welcome to the dataset repository for the Code Smell Detection project. This dataset has been meticulously processed and cleaned from the orginal **MLCQ dataset** [1] to facilitate research and analysis. It incorporates various features obtained from three pre-trained models (CodeBERT, CuBERT, and code2vec), token indexing using the [Tokenizer](https://github.com/dspinellis/tokenizer), and software metrics extracted with the [ck tool](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/ck).

## Dataset Contents
1. **Embedding Vectors:**
   - **Models:** CodeBERT, CuBERT, and code2vec
   - **Features:**
     - `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each code sample.
     - `embedding`: Vector representation obtained from the pre-trained models.
     - `label`: Indicates the presence of a specific code smell.

2. **Token Indexing:**
   - **Tool:** [Tokenizer](https://github.com/dspinellis/tokenizer)
   - **Features:**
     - `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each code sample.
     - `embedding`: Token indices generated by the Tokenizer.
     - `label`: Indicates the presence of a specific code smell.

3. **Software Metrics:**
   - **Tool:** [ck tool](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/ck)
   - **Features:**
     - `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each code sample.
     - `metrics`: Vector containing various object-oriented metrics.
     - `label`: Indicates the presence of a specific code smell.

4. **Combined feature**
   - **Features:**
     - `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each code sample.
     - `metrics`: Vector containing various object-oriented metrics.
     - `embedding`: Vector representation obtained from the pre-trained models or token indexing.
     - `label`: Indicates the presence of a specific code smell.
